            <ul>Some lines from the article : </ul>
            <li>1. Stop Lying to Ourselves: If you’re serious about getting better at something, then one of the first steps is to know—in black-and-white terms—where you stand. You need self-awareness before you can achieve self-improvement.</li>
            <li>2. Eliminate Time Wasting Activities by Using the Eisenhower Box: This simple decision matrix will help you take action, organize tasks, and get more done. The great thing about this matrix is that it can be used for broad productivity plans (“How should I spend my time each week?”) and for smaller, daily plans (“What should I do today?”).</li>
            <li>3. <a href="https://jamesclear.com/buffett-focus" target="_blank"><b>Warren Buffett’s “2 List” Strategy: How to Maximize Your Focus and Master Your Priorities:</b></a> This method comes from the famous investor Warren Buffett and uses a simple 3-step productivity strategy to help you determine your priorities and actions. You may find this method useful for making decisions and getting yourself to commit to doing one thing right away.</li>
            <li>4. <a href="https://jamesclear.com/ivy-lee" target="_blank"><b>The Ivy Lee Method:</b></a> The Daily Routine Experts Recommend for Peak Productivity: This productivity strategy is straightforward: Do the most important thing first each day. The Ivy Lee Method is a dead simple way to implement this strategy.</li>
            <li>5. <b>Manage your energy, not your time:</b>
                If you take a moment to think about it, you’ll probably realize that you are better at doing certain tasks at certain times. What type of energy do you have in the morning? Afternoon? Evening? Determine what tasks each energy level and time of day are best suited for.</li>
            <li>6. <b> Prepare the night before:</b>
                If you only do one thing each day then spend a few minutes each night organizing your to–do list for tomorrow. When I do it right, I’ll outline the article I’m going to write the next day and develop a short list of the most important items for me to accomplish. It takes 10 minutes that night and saves 3 hours the next day.</li>
            <li>7. <b> Turn your phone off and leave it in another room:</b>
                Or on your colleague's desk. Or at the very least, put it somewhere that is out of sight. This eliminates the urge to check text messages, Facebook, Twitter, and so on. This simple strategy eliminates the likelihood of slipping into half–work where you waste time dividing your attention among meaningless tasks.</li>
            <li>8. <b> Sit up or stand up:</b>
                When you sit hunched over, your chest is in a collapsed position and your diaphragm is pressing against the bottom of your lungs, which hinders your ability to breathe easily and deeply. Sit up straight or stand up and you’ll find that you can breathe easier and more fully. As a result, your brain will get more oxygen and you’ll be able to concentrate better.</li>

    <ul>
            <li>Some lines from the article : </li>
            <li>1. Self-development is a lifelong process—but not a linear process. New situations will require new and different skills, and challenges often arise in adult life when you least expect them. But that process of setting personal goals and looking inside yourself is some of life’s most profound and rewarding work. If this process is new to you, that’s okay—start small.</li>
            <li>2. No one can read your mind. Thinking about who needs to know what information and the best way to convey it is an art, and it’s worth it to spend time working on it.</li>
            <li>3. Effective time management skills and good habits will help ensure your actions match your goals</li>
            <li>4. Your education doesn’t stop when you’ve got a diploma or degree in hand. In fact, some might say that’s when your real education begins.</li>
            <li>5.  Being adventurous is a real skill. If you’re someone who isn’t prone to taking risks but wants to have new experiences, maybe you can set your mind to expanding your horizons a little bit at a time.</li>

        <p>Feedback is essential for improving your performance, as it can increase your motivation and confidence by recognizing your accomplishments, clarify your expectations and goals by aligning them with the standards and criteria of your field or situation, identify your gaps and errors by pointing out where you need to improve or correct your actions, provide suggestions and solutions by offering advice, guidance, or resources that can help you overcome your challenges, and encourage your growth and development by stimulating your curiosity, creativity, and learning.</p>

        <p>NVC can be a useful tool when communicating with others in the workplace, such as in meetings, feedback sessions, negotiations, or conflicts. To make the most of it, observe what is happening without adding your interpretation or evaluation. Additionally, express how you feel about the situation without blaming or accusing the other person. Identify your needs or values that are related to your feelings without imposing them on the other person. Finally, make a request that is clear, specific, and doable without demanding or expecting compliance. For example, instead of saying "You are always late", say "I value timeliness and efficiency - would you be willing to come 10 minutes earlier next time?". Using NVC in this way can help inform and reassure stakeholders while providing valuable insights for improving communication.</p>

        <p>EI is composed of four main skills: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and label your emotions and how they affect your thoughts and behavior. Self-management is the ability to regulate your emotions and impulses and adapt to changing situations. Social awareness is the ability to empathize and understand the emotions and needs of others. Relationship management is the ability to communicate effectively and build trust and rapport with others. EI is important because it can enhance your personal well-being, your performance at work, your leadership skills, and your social interactions.</p>

        <p>The key to developing your self-awareness is to practice it consistently. You can't expect to become more self-aware by using an app once in a while. You need to make it a habit and integrate it into your daily routine. For example, you can use an app to meditate in the morning, write down your thoughts and feelings in the evening, or check in with your emotions throughout the day. You can also set reminders or notifications to help you stay on track.</p>

        <p>Being and feeling stuck in life is an awful place to be.
            When you are stuck, it feels as though you are literally just spinning your wheels in the mud and running around in circles.
            It also feels as though no matter what you do or say, nothing will ever change for the better and you’ll be stuck in a rut forever.
            If you're not careful, being stuck in life can magnify the fear, guilt, shame, and/or apathy you’re already feeling. You can become even more stuck than you already are.
            So rather than doing nothing and allowing yourself to get sucked into a really terrible rabbit hole, let’s explore 10 ways to reinvent yourself so you – and your life – can start to become unstuck.</p>

        <p>There’s a popular quote that’s floated around the internet for years.
            It’s often attributed to the famed 20th-century physicist Albert Einstein: “If you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.”
            There’s not much evidence that Einstein ever said that…but does it matter?
            Does it make the basic logic behind the statement any less true or less inspiring?
            Unfortunately, the way we evaluate peoples’ skills and abilities makes about as much sense as judging a fish by its climbing ability.</p>
