    <h2 class="subheading">About running and jogging : </h2>
    <p>Jogging or running is a popular form of physical activity. About one in 5 Australians try running
         (or jogging) at some stage in their life. Running is an appealing exercise because it doesn't cost
          a lot to take part and you can run at any time that suits you.
    Some runners choose to participate in fun runs, athletics races or marathons. If you are interested 
    in competing with other runners, contact your local running club.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subheading">Health benefits of running and jogging : </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1. help to build strong bones, as it is a weight bearing exercise</li>
        <li>2. strengthen muscles</li>
        <li>3. burn plenty of kilojoules</li>
        <li>4. improve cardiovascular fitness</li>
        <li>5. help maintain a healthy weight</li>
        <li>6. Aerobic exercise gets your heart rate up and makes you sweat. This can boost the size of your hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning.</li>
        <li>7. Many people run because they want to feel better. The exercise helps boost your mood, concentration, and overall quality of life.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="Article_Heading">Cardiovascular exercises and their benefits : </p>
    <h2 class="subheading">What is cardio? : </h2>
    <p>
        “Cardio” comes from the Greek word “kardía,” which means heart. Simply put, exercise typically counts as cardio if it involves intentional coordinated physical actions that raise your heart rate for an extended period of time.
        
        A good cardiovascular workout will have you consistently breathing faster than you would while resting. The result: More oxygen in your blood for your heart to pump to the rest of your body.
        
        You'll also hear cardio referred to as “aerobic exercise.” The term emphasizes the enhanced movement and utilization of oxygen for energy production when you're engaged in a cardiovascular workout.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subheading">List of all of the activities below fall into the category of cardiovascular exercise : </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Cycling</li>
        <li>2. Running or jogging.</li>
        <li>3. Rowing</li>
        <li>4. Swimming</li>
        <li>5. Cross-country skiing.</li>
        <li>6. Walking and hiking.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="subheading">How cardio benefits your body : </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Increasing blood flow and decreasing chances of stroke.</li>
        <li>2. Improving memory and thinking ability.</li>
        <li>3. Combatting a decline in brain function with age.</li>
        <li>4. Protecting your brain against developing Alzheimer's disease.</li>
        <li>5. <b>Improves blood sugar regulation</b>: Staying active helps improve blood sugar control, decreases stress on this vital organ and reduces your chance of developing Type 2 diabetes.</li>
        <li>6. Strengthens your immune system</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="subheading">Some general tips for beginners : </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Make sure you eat a healthy, well-balanced diet.</li>
        <li>2.  If you're just getting started with cardio exercise, opt for the moderate-intensity level as an initial step in order to better allow your muscles and joints to get used to the movements.</li>
        <li>3. If you're a beginner, a great place to start is with about three days of exercise with a day of rest in between.</li>
        <li>4. Begin each cardio session with a 5-10 minute warm-up.</li>
        <li>5. For the first few weeks, focus on showing up for your workouts and building time. You have plenty of time to work on your speed and distance.</li>
        <li>6. If using headphones, do not have the sound too loud - stay alert and aware.</li>
        <li>7. Increase Your Workout Time by a Few Minutes</li>

    <p class="Article_Heading">Leg exercises and their benefits : </p>
    <h2 class="subheading">Movement patterns in a good leg workout : </h2>
    <p>When it comes to designing an effective leg workout, simpler is better. The basic lower body movements — squats, hip hinges (deadlifts), and lunges — should comprise the majority of your programming.

        These movements inherently focus on the major muscle groups of the legs: the glutes, quads, hamstrings, and calves.
        
        Once you master these movements, there are plenty of variations and ways to progress that will keep you challenged.
        
        When designing your leg workout, here's an easy way to break it down: Start with a squat movement, then move to a hip-hinge movement, then add in your single-leg movements.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subheading">How many sets and reps should you do in your leg workout? : </h2>
    <p>
        As a beginner looking to increase general fitness — and following the theme of keeping things simple — choose 3-5 exercises per leg workout. Then complete 3 sets of 8-12 reps of each exercise, ensuring that you’re working your muscles to fatigue but not failure (1).

Why no more than 5 exercises? You'll be able to focus on those integral movements, performing at your peak. If your workouts get too long, they can be unproductive.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subheading">How many times per week should you work legs? : </h2>
    <p>
        Recent research suggests that when trying to maximize muscle growth, there's not much difference between training the major muscle groups one time per week versus three times per week (3).

        What makes the most difference in muscle growth is resistance training volume, meaning how many sets and reps you're completing. Higher volume sessions (say, 3 sets of 12 reps, or even 4 sets of 8 reps) tend to produce better results than working the same muscle group multiple times in a week (4).
    </p>
    <h2 class="subheading">How to warm up and cool down properly : </h2>
    <p>An effective workout isn't complete without a proper warmup and cooldown.

        For your warmup, aim to start with 5 minutes of light cardio to get your heart rate up and blood flowing. If you have time, hop on the foam roller for 5 minutes of soft-tissue release.
        
        Then, dive into a dynamic stretching routine, with movements like leg swings, hip openers, bodyweight squats, and lunges.
        
        After your workout is a good time to complete a more in-depth stretching routine.

    <p class="Article_Heading">Types of Exercises : </p>
    <p>Most people tend to focus on one type of exercise or activity and think they're doing enough.
         Research has shown that it's important to get all <b>four</b> types of exercise: endurance, strength, 
         balance, and flexibility. Each one has different benefits. Doing one kind also can improve your 
         ability to do the others, and variety helps reduce boredom and risk of injury.</p>
    <h2 class="subheading">1) Endurance related exercises : </h2>
    <p>Endurance activities, often referred to as aerobic, increase your breathing and heart rates. These activities help keep you healthy, improve your fitness, and help you perform the tasks you need to do every day. Endurance exercises improve the health of your heart, lungs, and circulatory system. They also can delay or prevent many diseases that are common in older adults such as diabetes, colon and breast cancers, heart disease, and others.
        <b>Muscular endurance refers to the ability of a given muscle to exert force against a load, consistently and repetitivelyTrusted Source, over a period of time.</b><br>
        Physical activities that build endurance include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Brisk walking or jogging</li>
        <li>Yard work (mowing, raking)</li>
        <li>Dancing</li>
        <li>Climbing</li>
        <li>Swimming</li>
        <li>Biking</li>
        <li>Climbing stairs or hills</li>
        <li>Playing tennis or basketball</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="subheading">Strength exercises : </h2>
    <p>Your muscular strength can make a big difference. Strong muscles help you stay independent and make 
        everyday activities feel easier, like getting up from a chair, climbing stairs, and carrying 
        groceries. Keeping your muscles strong can help with your balance and prevent falls and fall-related
         injuries. You are less likely to fall when your leg and hip muscles are strong. Some people call 
         using weight to improve your muscle strength “strength training” or “resistance training.”

        Read and share this infographic and help spread the word about the everyday benefits of exercise and
         physical activity.
        Some people choose to use weights to help improve their strength. If you do, start by using light
         weights at first, then gradually add more. Other people use resistance bands, stretchy elastic bands
          that come in varying strengths. If you are a beginner, try exercising without the band or use a light
           band until you are comfortable. Add a band or move on to a stronger band (or more weight) when you can 
           do two sets of 10 to 15 repetitions easily. Try to do strength exercises for all of your major muscle 
           groups at least 2 days per week, but don't exercise the same muscle group on any 2 days in a row.
